title: front end or back end?
---

Deciding whether you want to work in Front End Development or Back End Development is a big decision - they can involve some pretty different ways of thinking,  Once you hear a bit about them, I think you'll have a pretty good idea of which you prefer.

Front end development handles displaying content - on the web, that means all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that goes into the elements you see on screen.  All the elements you interact with, all the changes that happen - that's Front End, the displaying of data and the handling of user input.  This doesn't _just_ mean websites - but, let's be honest, usually it's websites and webapps. Front End developers primarily write in JavaScript, with a small minority using python or ruby.  FEDevs will usually have design documents, art assets, things like that, and they'll have to get good at incorporating expectations in their work - because a lot more people will care.

Where do front end developers get their data?  What happens with the user input?  That's the Back End.  Back end development can actually mean several quite different kinds of work, depending on whether you're in a web development context or applications.
