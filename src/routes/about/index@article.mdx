Queer Coding is a (side) project of a Main Developer (Nick) and a Junior Developer (Danny).  

Nick is a Web Developer and Librarian (currently looking to move on from his current position!  Get in touch!), and has been for about a decade, and a _Member of the LGBTQ+ Community_.  His commitment to helping LGBTQ+ comes from a long life in the community and seeing too many examples of how destitute people can become just because they came out.

Danny is our First Experiment, and mostly doesn't even mind.  Danny is a _Member of the LGBTQ+ Community_.  He is a sucker for small furry animals so if you're looking to trick him into helping with your website, use cute animal photos to your advantage.

_The backgrounds are random things I've found on the internet over the years.  If you're a copyright holder for one of them, and would like us to take yours out, let us know!_
