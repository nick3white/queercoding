    QC: Myron
pagetitle: Departed Friends

This isn't "QC" talking anymore, this is me.  I've been a part of various LGBTQ+ communities since back when that acronym was half as long as it is today.  From college campuses, to inner city club kids, I've known people who gave up everything &mdash; literally everything: family, friends, jobs, homes &mdash; just because they wanted to feel comfortable being themselves.  It's not fair, it's cruel, and it's inhumane &mdash; but it's the world we live in.

Over the years, things have gotten _so much better_, and that's wonderful.  But it's still not perfect, and for a lot of people, it's exactly the same as it was 30 years ago.

I'm not in a situation anymore where I can offer my couch, but I can still offer my ear.  And, I think, I can also offer what QC's trying to do.  There are so many resources on the web to help people learn to code, but it can be difficult to know where to start, and it can be hard to do it without a friend.  I can be that friend.  But that's not what this page is about.  You can go [here](/you) to read that mini-essay.  

This page is jsut an attempt to have a memorial for the friends that didn't make it.  I've lost so many people; we all have.  I want to take a moment to remember one of them, first, because he was my best friend, and second, because, if you're feeling anything like how he was feeling, I want you to know that there are people who care about you, and there are people who will think about you in 20 years &mdash; hopefully the tears running down their faces will be tears of happiness about how well you're doing, and not the tears of sorrow on my face right now.

Myron and I outwardly didn't have much in common.  We met when we were about 15 or so; I was into punk rock and goth and I had basically no respect for anyone that didn't completely agree with me on literally every topic.  Myron was into Magic the Gathering, Wicca, and R&B &mdash; sure, there's some cultural overlap there, but it wasn't 100% overlap so I was skeptical at first.  I was from a family of PhDs; we didn't have a lot of money but we were fine.  Myron was the middle child of 9 from a poor family from the inner city &mdash; his mom had submitted forms saying he lived with his aunt, that was how he was able to go to our suburban school.  He didn't live with his aunt though; he mostly lived on other people's couches.  He was sociable and likeable and crazy smart and very handsome; I was undiagnosed autistic and better at making enemies accidentally than anyone else around.  I was white, Myron was black.

I don't remember how our friendship started, but I remember where it went.  We kinda...figured ourselves out together.  My "couch" was one of the couches he spent the most time on...I didn't have a couch in my bedroom, but we "figured it out"...

High school continued; my shit went off the rails &mdash; I ended up dropping out, homeless & living in a tree house, and eventually moving halfway across the country because a friend offered me a place to live.  Myron graduated with great grades, but, being poor and black, all the guidance he got was that the military would be a good option.  He signed up and spent a few years in Germany, and got some money to help with college.  When that was over, he floated around the country a bit, and then floated back nearby.  I had gotten deep into drugs and we weren't getting along great &mdash; but he still lived at my house as often as not.

He would disappear for days, weeks, months.  As I'm sure a lot of you know, when you're couch surfing, you live in this perpetual state of overstaying your welcome, and, constantly aware of this, he would bounce around, so it wasn't worrisome not to see him for a while.  He wasn't in a great place, mentally or physically.  He hadn't been able to finish college &mdash; the money his absent father promised to send never appeared (I'M NOT RESENTFUL THO).  He didn't have any useful skills; as any veteran will tell you, the work you do in the military doesn't often transfer very well.  He was aimless and homeless and poor and black and not straight.  He had been doing a lot of party drugs (_not_ heroin, which was my drug of choice, and, because of my absurd black and white thinking, that was as good as no overlap at all), and hanging out with a group of friends that my group of friends didn't really know.

So it wasn't that weird that he "went missing" &mdash; no one really knew he was missing; there wasn't exactly a group chat for all his friend groups.  This was before group chats; this was before chats; none of us even had cellphones back then.

In September of 2000, he was found floating in a river.  He had been in the river for a couple of weeks; apparently they couldn't tell if he was white or black; his mother identified him from his tattoos.

After his funeral, my mother gave me a copy of a poem.  I can't remember anything about it other than one line: "I look forward to the time I think of you only once a day".  It's been over 20 years and that day still hasn't come.
