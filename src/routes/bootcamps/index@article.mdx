## Bootcamps

There are plenty of bootcamps and training sites out there.  Some of them are probably good, I have no idea - you'll have to look elsewhere for reviews of them - but I can add a few pros and cons that you can consider when thinking about them.

### Pros

1. they can offer discipline.  A lot of aspiring developers just kinda wander off and never finish anything - and if you're concerned that will happen to you, a bootcamp might be the right choice.

2. Some of them reward certificates - lean towards those.  Without work experience, you're going to need to point to something - and we'll help you get some sample work build and get you a decent portfolio - but certificates aren't bad.  Probably can't hurt, right?

3. For sure check reviews, comments, reddit/lemmy threads - don't go to the first one you find out about unless you've properly vetted it a bit.  That said, a bootcamp is kind of a hard thing to do badly - and we'll go into why in the Cons section - but - in summary, it's not hard to teach the introductory concepts of javascript.  Obviously some teachers are better than others, but as long as the one you go to isn't a literal scam, it's probably fine.

### Cons

0. They cost money.  Like several thousand dollars.

1. They don't take you very far.  And how could they - anything that you could actually learn 100% in 6 weeks wouldn't be something people need a bootcamp for.  Like all the cool stuff in life, you will keep learning your entire career.  And after a little while, you're going to have to put your knowledge to work in real situations - partly because you need to really understand how all the pieces fit together in the real world; and partly because you need to screw up.  Mistakes are how we learn; copying and pasting correct, vetted code - that's great, it shows you what a function looks like.  But in order to learn how to write code, you need to write code that doesn't work.  You need to learn how to take code that you wrote - that doesn't do what you think it should - and make it work.

2. They still require commitment, dedication, and attention - they aren't a conveyor belt; the students that come out of them and get jobs afterwards took it seriously, paid attention, and put in the work.

3. As far as I know, there's no one checking on these things - no accredating organization to determine who's good and who's just out to scam some money

### My verdict:

They're super expensive.  You can do everything they do in the same amount of time for free at the resources at the [javascript 101](/js) page.  If you want to do it fast, do it fast.  If you want to know whether you're "job ready" after doing your homemade bootcamp, contact us.

if you have the money and you really want to do one, we at QC certainly won't think less of you - there are some great programs out there.  We'll still help you with your resume and job hunting and all that.

But, a lot of people aren't swimming in money and free time, and we don't want anyone to feel like they have to spend thousands of dollars when it's not necessary.
