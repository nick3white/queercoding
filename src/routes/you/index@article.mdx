Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: this site is here to help LGBTQ+ people who have been having a hard time, and who want to learn to code - mostly to help get a career going, or to start a new one - but also, just for fun.

If you fit that description, then, sure!  This is for you.

We're not ally-phobic by any means.  We recognize that there are loads of things that can drain you and leave you wanting this kind of help - mental illness, neurodiversity, or the endless number of ways that we can get dropped into a shitty situation.  We're not turning anyone away at this point.

If you feel like the resources and time and energy that are here for people in need would be fairly spent on you, we're happy to help.  

(And we don't even check your LGBTQ+ membership card so you could even lie about it if you want.)
