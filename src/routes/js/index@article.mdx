This site has plenty of general info and overviews and long winded diatribes.  But - you're here, so I think you might be ready to be done with that. 

Let's learn some code.



There are plenty of bootcamps and training sites out there.  Some of them might be ok, I have no idea - you'll have to look elsewhere for reviews of them - but I will say, on the plus side, they provide an outside discipline that's really helpful for some people.  Some of them reward certificates - lean towards those.  Without work experience, you're going to need to point to something - and we'll help you get more than nothing, but a certificates aren't bad.  In an industry that has so many self-taught developers, certificates are a lot more meaningful in development than in, I don't know, banking or whatever.  Whatever normal people do.
