Coming out is brave.  It may not feel like it &mdash; it may not feel like it if you're still terrified sometimes, or it may not feel like it when you feel like you had it easy compared to other people.  But bravery is an action, not a feeling &mdash; the moments we are the bravest don't feel like moments to be proud of, they feel wobbly and unsure and extremely scary.  Doing it anyway is what makes it brave.

For those of you who felt all of that fear straight down to your toenails, we're so proud of you.  All of us &mdash; the entire LGBTQ+ community.  We're proud of you, and we're grateful &mdash; your bravery makes it that much easier for the next person.  Thank you.

For those of you who feel like their experience coming out wasn't as bad as it was for some other people's &mdash; sure, that makes sense, and that's a compassionate thought that you're having &mdash; but you're not that person, you're not anyone else.  You have one life to live, and this is it, and in this life, you chose to come out.  We're proud of you too, and we're grateful to you, too.
